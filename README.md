## Description:
This library contains basic Mandani fuzzy inference system classes. Moreover, a manufacturing effort model for predicting effort and costs of braided structures is provided. 

## How to run:
- See each class' comments
- Simply run "BraidME.py" and chose test case via variable TestCase
- The following test cases are defined via variable TestCase:
 o TestX     ... Just evaluate effort
 o TestXSens ... Compute effort and sensitivities
 o PlotSurfaces ... Plot all relevant response surfaces
 o PlotRules ... Plot all implemented rules
 o Costs     ... Compute costs of given design
 o MEInpDict ... Generate input dictionary
 o MEInpDictSens ... Compute input and sensitivities
- Or directly consult author by mail
