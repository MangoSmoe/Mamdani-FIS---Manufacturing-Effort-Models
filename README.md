## Description:
This library contains basic Mandani fuzzy inference system classes. Moreover, a manufacturing effort model for predicting effort and costs of braided structures is provided. 

## How to run:
- See each class' comments
- Simply run "BraidME.py" and chose test case via variable TestCase
- The following test cases are defined via variable TestCase:
   - **TestX**:Just evaluate effort
   - **TestXSens** Compute effort and sensitivities
   - **PlotSurfaces** Plot all relevant response surfaces
   - **PlotRules** Plot all implemented rules
   - **Costs** Compute costs of given design
   - **MEInpDict** Generate input dictionary
   - **MEInpDictSens** Compute input and sensitivities
- Or directly consult author by mail
